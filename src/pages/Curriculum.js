            Front-end developer with knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass,
            Tailwind, React, Angular, Object Oriented Programming and Functional
            Programming, as well as responsive and accessible web design, as
            well as manipulation of the DOM and databases in Firebase, seeking
            enter the industry and gain experience in the field.<br></br>
            Bachelor in Biological Sciences from the Federal University of S√£o
            Carlos, where I was part of the Observatory of the Sorocaba and
            M√©dio Tiet√™ River Basin Committee, promoting activities and
            expanding Civil Society access and participation in issues and
            decisions involving the Basin.<br></br> I also participated in the
            Apet√™ Capu√£ Agroecology Center, which promotes articulations and
            discussions on agroecology in Sorocaba and in the region,
            culminating in a publication on Agriculture and Conservation, where
            I was able to analyze the perception and socioeconomic relationship
            of small rural producers, both agroecological and conventional, with
            the conservation. As a building technician, I had the experience of
            managing works and developing civil, infrastructure, energy,
            metro-rail projects, in addition to working on civil budgets for
            technical and commercial proposals, including using techniques and
            knowledge obtained at the University for the production of
            proposals.
            <br></br>
            Being communicative and proactive, I always worked to help my team
            achieve their goals, which made me work with quotes, purchases,
            projects and document controls.
