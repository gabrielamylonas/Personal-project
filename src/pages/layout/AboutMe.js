        I'm a non-binary developer, with a background in biology and
        agroecology, and also in infrastructure works, such as in rail transport
        and power supply. I am passionate about nature and art. I believe that a
        person's passions say a lot about them, so here I present a list of 10
        of my favorite books and films, as well as my main beliefs and
        motivations.
